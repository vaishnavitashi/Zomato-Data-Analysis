# Zomato-Data-Analysis
Zomato Restaurant Data Analysis Project
This project involved analyzing Zomato restaurant data using advanced Excel functions and SQL queries, and creating interactive dashboards using Power BI and Tableau. The objectives of the project were:

Building a country map table
Building a calendar table using the column datekey and adding columns such as year, monthno, monthfullname, quarter(Q1,Q2,Q3,Q4), yearmonth (YYYY-MMM), weekdayno, weekdayname, financialmonth (April = FM1, May= FM2 â€¦ March = FM12), and financial quarter (quarters based on financial month)
Finding the number of restaurants by city and country
Analyzing restaurant opening trends by year, quarter, and month
Counting restaurants by average ratings
Creating buckets for average price ranges and finding out how many restaurants fall in each bucket
Calculating the percentage of restaurants with table booking and online delivery options
Developing charts based on cuisines, city, ratings, and other relevant parameters
To achieve these objectives, the project used various advanced Excel functions such as VLOOKUP, PivotTables, and conditional formatting. SQL queries were executed to extract relevant data from the Zomato dataset. The resulting data was then used to create interactive dashboards using Power BI and Tableau, providing valuable insights into restaurant industry trends related to location, opening trends, ratings, and price ranges.
